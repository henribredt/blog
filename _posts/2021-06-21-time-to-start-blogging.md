For some time now there has been an item in my to-do list inbox: start a blog. And today is the day where I can cheerfully check off this task. From time to time I will share my personal thoughts on topics that matter to me. I don't want to impose any rules on myself here, this is supposed to be a creative place for my thoughts. Topics I will be covering might be design, productivity, health, personal projects, great books and what ever strikes my mind.

## Aren't there enough blogs out there already?
Yeah. But I don't mind. I believe that we humans find our strength in the exchange of thoughts, knowledge and discussions with others - thatâ€™s why I started to share my experiences with creating apps and designing user experiences in 2019 on [Instagram][insta] and [Twitter][twitter]. This blog is my personal next step. If it helps to inspire someone or to start a single respectful discussion, its worth it. I want to invite you to drop a mail whenever you feel like commenting, agreeing, diagreeing or connecting.

## About this blog
I have build this blog with [Jekyll][jekyll] using the [Tale][tale] theme. It's pretty easy - if you want to start your own blog with  Jekyll too, check out this [playlist][playlist] on YouTube that helped me getting started. Jekyll is a static site generator and you can easily write posts like these in Markdown.

Thanks for reading, have a stunning day!  
Henri
