This post serves two purposes: First, I want you to think about you consume of alcohol and maybe decide do limit its consumption or event stop it entirely. Second, this is the explanation I'll from now on always refer to when people I come arount just cant belive that I don't want to drink that beer, that I dont want a Gin instead and that I'd love to take something like a nice maracuja schorle instaed. And that not drinking alcohol isn't wierd - its actually much more wierd that aclcohol is so commonly accepted and wide spread if you think about it.

## Social super power
I've seen many people being drunk and been drunk my self. As far as I noticed Alochol seems to change peoples character - including my own. It makes me more open, more social, more engaging - and less thoughtful. Generally three, in some cases four, personal proerties I wish I had permanently, as beeing a more introvetred human. I enjoy listening and think before I speek - sometimes the thinking takes a little to long so that the conversation has already carried on. Drinking alcohol is widle accepted, not to say that its assumed. A lot of "networking" is tighly integrated with it. "Shall we meet after work and drink a beer together?" is a common question and answering "I don't drink beer but, yeah why not meet and drink water?" doesn't exactly sound like good networking.

## How bad can it be?
Alcohol is like Microsoft Windows, its only used because its wide spread and other from it beeing wide spread there are no reasons for it. (Yeah, I havnt had a good time with windows, and I know there are people out there that actually like windows - thats fine. Like you windows thing, be happy but at least give linux or macOS a try). Okay note to myself: "Stick to the main topic!". Lets take a more scientfic approach at alcohol. It is a gift that stops our brain from working, stresses our leber and prevents us from seelping. Its reatively easy to become addicted to it and is classified as a drug. Buuuut ... everyone drinks it - so how bad can it be? Pretty bad if we come back to the windows comparison.
