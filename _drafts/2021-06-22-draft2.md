Its a mystherium, some people seemd to be blessed with it and some are logical instad. Somebody beeing both creative and logical is impossible. Its like black and white, on and off, creative or not creative. I neglect to accept common ideas like that. This post tells why, without bevieling I have masterd the whole creativity thing. This is what I have learnd so far and what I belive to be true (at least for myself).
