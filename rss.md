## About
I'm passionate about coding and design, currently studying user experience design and developing apps for iOS and macOS alongside. I care about aesthetics and value simplicity. Find out more about me and what I do on my [website][web]. I run this blog using a static site generator called [Jekyll][jekyll] with a custom theme heavily inspired by [Tale][tale]. The used font is [Inter][inter]. This blog went live  on 21. July 2021.
