## Little  bio
Hello. I'm passionate about coding and design, currently studying user experience design and developing apps for iOS and macOS alongside. I care about astehtics and value simplicity. Find out more about me and what I do on my [website][web].


## The blog
I run this blog using a static site generator called [Jekyll][jekyll] with a custom theme heavily inspired by [Tale][tale]. That allows me to easily write posts in markdown and have a secure & fast website. The blog went live  on 21. Juli 2021.
